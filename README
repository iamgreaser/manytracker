SOME KEYS. NOTE: this doesn't autostart now!

F5 = play from start
F6 = play pattern (looped)
Shift-F6 = play from order
F7 = play from row
F8 = STOP <-- very, very important!

ok so current status:

it works fairly well as a player, considering i haven't been working on it for very long.

it has:
- instruments!
- filters!
- buggy ping-pong loops!
- buggy NNAs!
- surround sound!
- IT v1 instruments!
- backwards compatibility with old IT versions!
- no attempt at modplug compatibility! yes, that's ACTUALLY A FEATURE!
- close adherence to the ITTECH.TXT flowchart!
- amiga slides!
- PROPER IT-STYLE NON-AMIGA SLIDES oh yes take that modplug you sack of crap
- fadeout! P.S. I HATE YOU XM AND I WANT YOU TO DIE FOREVER
- stereo samples!
- IT214 compressed samples!
- *IT215* compressed samples!
- ***STEREO*** compressed samples! (not extensively tested)
- at least a half-assed attempt at implementing the Cvt flags properly!
  - take that, everything that isn't IT! (how embarassing, would be so useful for zipping stuff up D:)
- PERFECT* Ixx IMPLEMENTATION! (* i might be wrong - it passes the Storlek tests though)
- correct instrument envelope looping! (none of this XM-y bollocks)
- voleffects!
- mod loader! probably still has bugs.
- s3m loader! ditto about the bugs.
- xm loader! DEFINITELY has bugs (it IS XM, after all)
- sample VIBRATO wow who uses that (umm... oddly enough i kinda do)
- pan / vol swing
- PITCH PAN SEPARATION WOW
- sample sustain loops!
- decent s3m pattern filtering! finally, a player that plays SATELL.s3m correctly!

and finally:
- *PLENTY* of bugs!

it doesn't quite have:
- MMCMP decompression
- all the effects
- IT v1 volume envelopes (uses the points instead of the curve... but it sounds fine!)
- out of range SDx (passes just as well as modplug does: it doesn't latch the new instrument)

it lacks:
- any form of input that isn't alt-f4, that X, or ctrl-c
- any form of networking
- a file saver
- all the panes that aren't the pattern pane
- embedded MIDI loading / timestamp crap
- duplicate check bollocks

some TODOs:
- work out how voleffect memory works in IT <= (2.14-2.14p2).
  - it's slightly different from how Storlek test #25 expects it.
- work out more wrt how Hx works.
  - mostly thinking of how it works wrt fine/unfine vibrato.

so uh yeah, this is where it's at (or more likely where it WAS at, and I haven't updated this yet).
