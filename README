ok so current status:

it works fairly well as a player, considering i haven't been working on it for very long.

it has:
- instruments!
- filters!
- buggy ping-pong loops!
- buggy NNAs!
- surround sound!
- IT v1 instruments!
- backwards compatibility with old IT versions!
- no attempt at modplug compatibility! yes, that's ACTUALLY A FEATURE!
- close adherence to the ITTECH.TXT flowchart!
- amiga slides!
- PROPER IT-STYLE NON-AMIGA SLIDES oh yes take that modplug you sack of crap
- fadeout! P.S. I HATE YOU XM AND I WANT YOU TO DIE FOREVER
- stereo samples!
- IT214 compressed samples!
- *IT215* compressed samples!
- ***STEREO*** compressed samples! (not extensively tested)
- at least a half-assed attempt at implementing the Cvt flags properly!
  - take that, everything that isn't IT! (how embarassing, would be so useful for zipping stuff up D:)
- PERFECT* Ixx IMPLEMENTATION! (* i might be wrong - it passes the Storlek tests though)
- correct instrument envelope looping! (none of this XM-y bollocks)
- voleffects!
- mod loader! probably still has bugs.

and finally:
- *PLENTY* of bugs!

it doesn't quite have:
- MMCMP decompression
- sample sustain loops (changed the mixing code, and i haven't implemented the necessary function :( )
- all the effects
- IT v1 volume envelopes (uses the points instead of the curve... but it sounds fine!)
- SDx (well, it's there but it doesn't work properly)

it lacks:
- any form of input that isn't alt-f4, that X, or ctrl-c
- any form of networking
- s3m/xm loaders (but I'll be keen to avoid XM for as long as I can!)
- a file saver
- all the panes that aren't the pattern pane
- embedded MIDI loading / timestamp crap
- sample vibrato
- vol/pan swing
- duplicate check bollocks

some TODOs:
- work out how voleffect memory works in IT <= (2.14-2.14p2).
  - it's slightly different from how Storlek test #25 expects it.
- work out more wrt how Hx works.
  - mostly thinking of how it works wrt fine/unfine vibrato.

so uh yeah, this is where it's at (or more likely where it WAS at, and I haven't updated this yet).
